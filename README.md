# Clicker

This addon will play a clicker sound effect for various events that the player can configure. This can help reinforce positive gameplay habits and increase motivation to achieve your goals! The list of events supported by the addon are below. Note that not all events are supported across all versions of WoW. I will do my best to add new events and keep support for all WoW flavors as the game progresses. If there is an issue with the addon, please comment or leave a bug report on the GitHub project page.

* Levelling up
* Quest completion
* Achievements
* Catching new battle pets
* Toy unlocks
* Mount unlocks
* BMAH Bid Win
* Various Housing unlocks
* New M+ Weekly Record
* MoP Challenge Mode Complete/New Record

Please include a detailed description of how the problem occurred, with screenshots and other supporting information so I can best diagnose the issue :)

This addon would not be possible without the amazing community from the WowUIDev Discord!
