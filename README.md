# clicker
This addon uses a clicker to reinforce positive gameplay habits or as a reward for completing achievements, levelling, looting certain items, or other configurable events!

This addon will play a clicker sound effect for various events that the player can configure. It can also optionally display an encouraging message set by the player when these events occur. This can help reinforce positive gameplay habits and increase motivation to achieve your goals! The list of events supported by the addon are below. Note that not all events are supported across all versions of WoW. I will do my best to add new events and keep support for all WoW flavors as the game progresses. If there is an issue with the addon, please comment or leave a bug report on the GitHub project page. No Artificial Intelligence was used in the writing of this addon's code, description, or any other content within.

* Levelling up
* Achievements
* First boss kill for that character (per-difficulty)
* First time catching battle pets
* Transmog set completion
* Toy unlocks
* Mount unlocks
* First loot of items specified by the player

If you run into any issues with the addon, please create a GitHub issue and specify the verison of the game and the version of the addon you're using. Please include a detailed description of how the problem occurred, with screenshots and other supporting information so I can best diagnose the issue :)

This addon would not be possible without the amazing community from the WowUIDev Discord, specifically "Numy"!
